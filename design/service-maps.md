# Service maps

This gives details and links to service maps we have created during the GOV.UK Forms design process.  

A service map, sometimes called a service blueprint, is “a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components — people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes — that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer journey." [Source Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)

GOV.UK Forms service maps visually represent users’ journeys and their interactions with the platform as they create forms. The maps have different levels of detail and information depending on the specific purpose they’re created for and the product’s phase at the time of creation. 

## Collecting data journey map - from early alpha
Early in the alpha phase, we created a process map to show the journey a service team takes to create a form to collect data, and the various people who would be involved in each step.

The map includes all the steps from when the need for a new or updated form arises - for example due to a policy change - to when the form is created, used to collect data, and then archived or retired. We made the map to capture the team’s assumptions and insights, and to identify any gaps or risks at each stage of the process.

## Proposed GOV.UK Forms user journey map - from late alpha
Later in alpha, we made a more detailed user journey map to include how people could use the proposed GOV.UK Forms service to create an online form. The steps in the journey and the user’s interactions on the proposed platform were informed by insights and assumptions we made from user research carried out in alpha. The map also showed the pain points and needs that users would have at different points of the journey when creating forms on GOV.UK Forms.

## Creating forms using GOV.UK Forms - private beta journey map
This map showed how people in government departments could use GOV.UK Forms to create accessible online forms during private beta. The map showed the steps for discovering and accessing GOV.UK Forms, including the onboarding process, agreeing to the MOU and getting access to the platform with the help of a GOV.UK Forms team member. It also showed the process to create forms and make them live, and what happens when a form goes live. This map was created for new team members and anyone interested in learning about how GOV.UK Forms works.

## Creating forms using GOV.UK Forms - Early Access journey map
GOV.UK Forms started the ‘Early Access’ phase in November 2023 to allow anyone with a gov.uk email address to create a trial account to see how the platform works. With a trial account users could create forms and request to upgrade to an editor account with permissions to make forms live. We created this detailed map and storyboard to show the journey for someone to start using GOV.UK Forms in early access, to try it out and to request to be upgraded to an 'Editor' account.
