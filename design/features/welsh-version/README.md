## What  

This feature adds a way for form creators to add Welsh translations to their forms in order to create a Welsh language version of their form. The platform will provide pre-translated elements that we currently don’t let form creators change or customise, such as continue buttons and change links. 


## Why  

A lot of services across government have a mandate to provide an equivalent in the Welsh language. This is regulated by the Welsh Language Commissioner. In order to help more forms and teams onboard to the GOV.UK Forms platform we need to be able to provide a way for form creators to add Welsh translations to a form. 


## Hypothesis  

We believe that allowing form creators to add translations to each of their content elements is the best option to make sure that forms are more reliably translated while allowing us to deliver for users.
