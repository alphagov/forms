## What 

Ways for users to manage the forms and groups within their organisation, with the first versions being focussed on organisation admin user types. This will allow them to organise their forms and groups, and minimise noise of unused groups and forms. 

## Why 

We know our organisation admins have various frustrations with managing the users, forms and groups in their organisations. Following a workshop with several org admins, we identified two priority things they need to be able to do:

- Move a form from one of their groups to another
- Delete a group they no longer need

## Iterations

### [Version 1 - Moving a form to a different group, August 2025](version-1.md)
Adds the ability for organisation admins to move a form to a different group in their organisation.

### Version 2 - Delete an empty group
This added the ability for organisation admins to delete a group if it has no forms in it.

### [Version 3 - Copy a form](version-3-copy-a-form.md)
Adds the ability for any form creator to copy a form. They can copy a draft, live or archived form into the same group.
