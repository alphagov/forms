## What 

This feature introduces ways for users to manage the forms and groups within their organisation, with the first versions being focussed on organisation admin user types. This will allow them to organise their forms and groups, and minimise noise of unused groups and forms. 

## Why 

We know our organisation admins have various frustrations with managing the users, forms and groups in their organisations. Following a workshop with several org admins, we identified two priority things they need to be able to do:

- Move a form from one of their groups to another
- Delete a group they no longer need
