# Features

We use this area to record design work and decisions made for specific features and types of functionality, including any iterations made to improve usability for form creators and form fillers.  

## Features we’ve designed  

### [Confirm that a form’s been submitted (form fillers)](confirmation-email-for-form-fillers)  
Allows form fillers to request an email confirming that they’ve successfully submitted a form.

### [Add guidance before a question (‘detailed guidance’)](detailed-guidance)  
Allows form creators to add lengthier and more complex help text before a question. 

### [Early access journey](early-access)  
Allowed people to create a trial account and request an upgrade to an editor account - so they could make live forms. Superseded by the group model for user management.

### [Editing pages when looking at a preview of a form](editing-drafts)  
Gives form creators an easier, clearer way to return to editing their questions from a preview of the form.

### [File upload](file-upload)  
Allows a form filler to upload a file.

### [Form management](forem-management)  
Ways for organisations to manage their forms such as deleting groups and moving forms. 

### [Metrics for form creators](form-metrics)  
Allows form creators to see how their form is performing. Starting with a minimum offering of: number of forms started, number of forms submitted, and completion rate.

### [Live and draft](live-draft)  
Allows form creators to make a draft of a live form so that you can prepare changes to it then make all the changes live at the same time.

### [Long lists and autocomplete ](long-list-autocomplete)  
Allows form creators to create longer lists of options and for form fillers to type to find an option to select from a list. 

### [Payment links](payment-links)  
Allows form creators to take payment with a form. 

### [Previewing a question](previewing-a-question)  
Helps form creators understand what an answer type will look like and how it’ll be formatted alongside other content they’ve added - including hint text and additional guidance.

### [Research email consent](research-email-consent)
Asks form creator users for consent to send an email to them about user research. 

### [Routing, branching and exit pages](routing)  
Allows form creators to create 2 branches of questions or to skip someone to a later question, or an exit page, based on an answer to a radio question.

### [User management journey](user-management)  
Gives organisations more control over who can create forms and who can make them live.
