## What  

This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to allow form creators to take a payment for their service. This way of taking payments uses the [payment page](https://payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/), or payment link, feature developed by GOV.UK Pay. 

The feature allows form fillers to pay for the service after submitting their form, making it quicker and easier to access the service or outcome they're seeking.


### User stories  

**As a form creator**, I need to request payment, so that I can provide a paid-for service to the form filler.  
**As a form creator**, I need to know how to set up payments, so I can take the steps needed to receive these.   

**As a form filler**, I need to be able to pay, so that I can access the service or outcome I’m seeking  in a timely manner.  
**As a form filler**, I need to know what to do after completing the form, or what will happen next, so I don’t feel confused or waste effort chasing things up unnecessarily.  
**As a form filler**, I need confirmation that my payment has been received, so I can feel confident that the transaction has gone through.  
**As a form filler**, I need a copy of the payment confirmation, so I have proof that I've completed what I needed to and don’t have any issues proving this later on.  
**As a form filler**, I need to know what part of the process I’m doing, so that I know I’m doing the right thing.  

**As a form processor**, I need to be able to check whether someone who’s filled in a form has paid, so I know what action to take next.  

**As a department**, I need to collect the money owed for the services we provide, so we can cover the costs of running an effective service (and clear our debt).  
**As a department**, I need to know when to set up a Pay account and how to do this, so that it’s in place by the time we need to receive payments.  


## Why  

Many document-based forms also require a payment for the service. This can be as a Bacs (Bankers' Automated Clearing System) payment or cheque, or it may be followed up with a link or phone call to request payment. 

This can make the process take longer, meaning the user doesn’t receive an answer or outcome in a timely manner. 

This process can also mean more work for internal staff as they may need to chase for payment or make follow-up calls before they can proceed.  

Introducing payment links to the GOV.UK Forms tool allows us to meet the needs of more forms that require payments, reducing the manual process for staff. Allowing form creators to add a link that can be quickly generated using GOV.UK Pay reduces the complexity of implementation for form creators. It also reduces the need for technical knowledge or special guidance within the Forms platform.   

## Hypothesis  

We believe that by offering the option to add a payment link to a form we can cater for more forms. This will let us meet the needs of form owners to digitise their forms, reducing the ‘long tail’ of online document-based forms.
