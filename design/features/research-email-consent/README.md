# Consent for email about user research

Date created: September 2025 

## What is it? 

This feature introduced a new page to the journey for people when they first create an account. 

The page asks them if they would be willing to get an email about user research. If they give their consent and select ‘Yes’, their name is then recorded in a report along with their email address and the time and date they consented. 

## Why 

The user research team wanted to recruit more people to the research panel to take part in user research. 

We had a SmartSurvey form that people needed to complete to sign up to the panel. We wanted to share this form with people when they created an account, but without disturbing their journey to create an account and start using the platform. To do this we had to get their consent to contact them about it separately.
