# Bracnhing feedback round 1

## 2025-02-03 / Sprint 13

## Aims
- These feedback rounds were planned as intermediary research where we could understand from a small group of users whether our design changes were heading in the right direction before carrying out more time-consuming, rigorous research.

They were not designed or planned as rigorous investigations, and therefore the findings and data should be treated with caution.

The aim was to understand whether the first part of of our recent iterations in response to the latest usability testing of branching were heading in the right direction:
* Is it easier for users to find where to do branching?
* Is it easier for users to understand how routing works?
* Is it easier for user to understand how to build 2 routes?

## Users
- Civil servants - existing users (mostly beginners)
- 4 users

## Methodology
- Informal observations of 2 users (like UR but not formalised)
- Access given to 7 users, of whom 2 who gave feedback at the end of a week.

## Key Headlines 
- "Changes to ""Add a route to a question"" have made it easier for users to select the question to set the 2nd route.

- Users find it hard to select questions to understand and set the 2nd route, however for the feedback sessions, we hadn't implemented all the improvements around this.

- Team decisions:
1) Change wording from take to to skip (before next round of testing)
2) Think how to help creators choose the questions in the ""Route 2: set questions to skip page"" (if possible, have something to show for next round of testing)"
