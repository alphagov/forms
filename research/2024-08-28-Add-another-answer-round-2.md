# Add another answer round 2 - usability testing

## 2024-08-28 / Sprint 2

## Aims
- Usability test the MVP for single repeated questions.

- Learn more about what works for people when building multiple repeated questions.

- We tried out 3 different entry points for building multiple repeated questions as well as 2 different ways of actually building them.


## Users
- GOV.UK Forms users (civil servants)
- 5

## Methodology
- interview
- usability testing of prototype
- usability/cognitive walkthrough of Mural designs

## Key Headlines 
- The MVP tested quite well but users need help understanding how to write the repeated questions to make it clear that users can add another answer.
- People didn't notice the maximum number of repeated answers.
- People questioned the need for a maximum and stated that any maximum would need to be much higher.
- The format of the MVP email seemed unproblematic - but these are not the real users, so recommend checking with actual data processors.
- The routing 'model' for building multiple repeated questions did not test well. Only one user (n=5) worked out how to do it and they said it was only due to test expectations. They also didn't find the process or the language logical.
- The 'add a question set' button was only discussed - it seemed reasonably clear to users, but with no confident consensus as to its purpose. Users would need to try it out.
- The radio option on the 'answer type' page worked well and users were confident that it would be what they needed to do. It helped to steer them through the journey.
- The iterated journey for building multiple repeated questions worked better than the previous concept, but some users still found it confusing - although all users managed to get it right in the end.
- In particular, they didn't understand what 'set name' to give their set, and how the structure of set name and questions worked.
- Three of the five were clear on how to finish building a set by editing their questions, however two found it confusing.
- One didn't notice the 'Edit' links at all, and several were confused by the wording of the links.
