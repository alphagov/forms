# Branching feedback round 2

## 2025-02-17 / Sprint 14

## Aims
These feedback rounds were planned as intermediary research where we could understand from a small group of users whether our design changes were heading in the right direction before carrying out more time-consuming, rigorous research. Recruitment and methodolgy did not follow the usual rigorous processes and were intended more as light touch checkins.

**They were not designed or planned as rigorous investigations, and therefore the findings and data should be treated with caution.**

The aim was to understand whether the first part of of our recent iterations in response to the latest usability testing of branching were heading in the right direction:
* Is it easier for users to find where to do branching?
* Is it easier for users to understand how routing works?
* Is it easier for users to understand how to build 2 routes?

## Participants
- Civil servants - existing users (mostly beginners)
- 6 participants

## Methodology
- 4 x Informal observations (run like usability testing but not formalised - different tasks set for different users)
- 1 x Access given to a user who gave feedback after a few hours of using it
- 1 x usability test of file upload and branching together

## Key Headlines
Allowing users to add a second route to a question from the 'Add a route to a question' page has made it easier for people to find where to add a second route.

Removing the next question from the second dropdown on 'Add a route to a question' has made it easier for some users to select the question to set the 2nd route. This depends on other factors, but can force users to think differently about their expectations and intended behaviour.

Users still find it hard to understand and set the 2nd route, especially from the 'Set questions to skip' page.

Our understanding of the users' mental model has solidifed: users think they need to 'build' each route separately, rather than adding all questions that all form fillers will flow through until you skip them over some questions.

Team decisions:
1) Decide the criteria that will give the team enough confidence to launch the feature
2) Further iteration session to design changes to help users understand and use 2 routes
3) Decide what further research is required
